# Final Project

For the final project, you must work alone. Choose one of the two
following options:

1. an ISL implementation of big-bang style game in the spirit of the
   falling game from assignments 2 and 4 or, <!--- haridu -->

2. a C++ implementation of two data structures from the list below
  (unless you choose BWT, in which case that one is sufficient)

If you choose option 1), your proposal must include a high-level
English description of the game (what are the objectives and what
style game is it), it must include at least 7 different features the
game will have, and it must include your best, first guess as to what
the data-definition will be for a `world`. (Note that this will
probably be wrong, but for subtle reasons that you will not discover
until you start working on the implementation of the game.)

If you choose option 2, you must choose two of the following data
structures to implement in C++:

* [splay tree](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sleator/papers/self-adjusting.pdf)
  <!--- relic -->

* [treap](http://faculty.washington.edu/aragon/pubs/rst89.pdf)
  <!--- siddharth -->

* [beap](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022000080900379)
  <!--- ismael -->

* [min-max heap](http://www.akira.ruc.dk/~keld/teaching/algoritmedesign_f03/Artikler/02/Atkinson86.pdf) <!--- sangrin -->

* [B-tree](http://people.cs.aau.dk/~simas/aalg06/UbiquitBtree.pdf)
  <!--- siddharth -->

* [Fibonacci heap](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall03/cs528/handouts/fibonacci%20heaps.pdf) <!--- relic --> 

* [rope](http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.14.9450&rep=rep1&type=pdf)

* [suffix trie](http://airelles.i3s.unice.fr/files/Weiner.pdf)
  <!--- sangrin -->

* [robin-hood hashing](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/research/tr/1986/CS-86-14.pdf)

* [suffix array](http://webglimpse.net/pubs/suffix.pdf)
  <!--- ismael -->

Or, you may choose to implement the [Burrows-Wheeler
transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrows%E2%80%93Wheeler_transform)
as an extenion to your compression project. (No second data structure is required in this case.)

<!--- undecided: michael -->

For your proposal, you must provide C++ class definitions, a
description of the ADT (like we showed in class), and a few test cases
(that will fail) that describe how the data structure works.

For the C++ choice, no two students may choose the same data
structures. Post your choices in Piazza; first come, first served.
